# Mobile Project Starter Repository
This is an Mobile Project starter repository repository.

## How to work
Each student group downloads this starter repository from the Mobile Project 
workspace at JAMK GitLab. After that, each student group (only one member) need to import this 
starter repository back to JAMK GitLab with his/her own account and complete
mobile project inside this repository with project group.

Student needs to send all the project group student names, studentIDs and 
repository url to teacher via email immediately after student has 
imported this repository back to GitLab using his/her own account 
(repository name and path is then available).

Student need to add teacher to repository member for an evaluation purposes. Teacher need at least Reporter role.
Student need to add other project group members to repository members. Other students
needs at least Developer role.

Student need to use this repository Issues Boards and drag an issues from 
<b>Backlog</b> to <b>Doing</b> section when student group start's working with an issue. 
Student group need to remember move an issue to <b>In Review</b> section in Issues Boards when student group has 
finished an issue work and pushed files back into his/her repository at JAMK GitLab. 
This way teacher knows that student has finished an issue and teacher can start an evaluation process with that issue. 
Teacher will move an issue to the <b>Closed</b> section in a Issues Boards when issue is approved. 
Teacher is monitoring your project learning process all the time!

Remember you can add an comments/notes to issues when you are moving it in Issues Boards. Teacher can also see your comments.

Read carefully all the informations and rules below before you start doing your project work!

## Repository structure
### README.md
Each mobile project repository should include README.md file which contains
information about your project work. Describe how the project has been done. 
Include needed links to other related materials in a web which describes how 
your/group have done a project work. You can record for example a video and upload it 
to YouTube or you can add videos and/or screenshots folder in your repository.
For video recording, you can use e.g. <a href="https://screencast-o-matic.com/" target="_blank">Screencast-O-Matic</a>.

Remember add your own self-evaluation (member and group) about your project work in README.md. Each project group member should write own self-evaluation.

You can/need/should modify this README.md file to your own purposes.

### Documentation folder
Each Mobile Project starter repository should include Documentation folder. This folder 
contains all created documentation. Each member of the project group need to 
keep track of what have done and when (important!). You can deside what tools your are using
to keep track of your doing and how you will present it here in the 
documentation. Project group need to keep a presentation 
and one good way is to use PowerPoint to made a few slides about your research. 
Prepare to show your application demo somehow. You can add Screenshots and/or
Videos folder inside your Documentation folder or link to YouTube. These 
screenshots and videos demonstrates your research demo application functionality. 
You can also record your presentation and include presentation video here in 
Documentation/Videos folder or publish it to YouTube and link it.

Project work will not be accepted if Documentation folder is missing 
and it doesn't contain needed materials for evaluation.  

### Other folders and files
Include all other research materials as a source codes etc... 
in this repository too.

to your repository and start doing your project work. Remember
check that teacher is member in your repository. All the evaluation criterias 
can be found in Mobile Project repository.

Remember use Issues Board when some of the issues are ready to move other lists in Issues Board.

## Tutorials and other sources used in research
If you are using tutorials to get familiar with your selected topic, or if 
you are using any lines of coding from some other  source, remember mention 
that in your documentation and your coding files. Mobile Project will 
not be accepted if it contains some other people made coding files and those
